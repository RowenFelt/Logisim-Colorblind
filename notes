PrefMonitor<Boolean> is defined in ./src/main/java/com/cburch/logisim/prefs/PrefMonitorBoolean.java
	really we should be looking for PrefBoolean.java found at

Something useful:
	printerView is found in src/main/java/com/cburch/logisim/gui/main/CanvasPainter.java:
	may be as simple as doing:
		boolean printerView = AppPreferences.PRINTER_VIEW.getBoolean(); in data

	imported using import com.cburch.logisim.prefs.AppPreferences
